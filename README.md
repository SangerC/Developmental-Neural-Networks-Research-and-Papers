## Expirements
The code directory contains the code and results

### Reinforcement Learning
The openaigym folder contains python files where I learned about using openaigym and pytorch.
The RL directory has a more finalized notebook file for running expirements with policy gradient and cartpole.
It also contains the results derived from it and a useful file for plotting with matplotlib.
