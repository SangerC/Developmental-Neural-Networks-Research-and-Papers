Title A Developmental Cognitive Architecture for Trust and Theory of Mind in Humanoid Robots

## Motivations
- AIs and robots will be entering the world and learning from interactions with humans
- Some human sources are unreliable such as the ones the Microsoft chat bot Tay that became a nazi learned from

## Goals
- Create a model of robot which can learn over time which sources are reliable

## Model
- Using an actor critic model based on the brain
- The actor takes in information through sensor and acts on the enviroment, and the critic gets feedback from the enviroment

## For our purposes
- Demonstrates an implementation of a multisectioned brain working together
- Could include sections which primarily act on each other as controls rather than acting on the enviroment
- Important step toward general AI
