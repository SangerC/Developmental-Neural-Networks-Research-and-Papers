Title A Conceptual Bio-Inspired Framework for the
Evolution of Artificial General Intelligence

## Motivations
- The advancement of AI towards general intelligence

## Goals
- Propose a general framwork for AI which could lead further towrds gen AI

## Model
- Unsupervised learning in a enviroment 
- Embodiment
- Spiking neurons
- Evolution passes down the structure of the networks, not weights
- Mutable enviroment
- Each neuron can learn in different ways ex: hebbian, anti-hebbian

## For our purposes
- Builds out a nice framework with a lot of details we are interested in incorporating
- Suggests using a game or prexisting mutable enviroment to train, would be cool to put AIs in a game
