# A Developmental Neuro-Robotics Approach for Boosting the Recognition of Handwritten Digits

link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9206857

Applies obeservations on childrens learning to machine learning

Uses a classic convolutional neural network

Developmental neuro-robotics

Information gradually becomes available

Supports the improvements of embodiment

fingers are spontaneous tools that play a crucial
role in developing number cognition until a
level of basic arithmetic is achieved

First they train a single layer to associate fixed finger representations to open and close robot fingers to the numbers 0-9

This can make AI more humanized and understandable, user can open and close its digits to fix errors

Used the MNIST Database of handwritten digits

Embodied modelis realized by including an addtional densly connected layer

trained with a 2-stage approach
1. final layer is trained to associate embodioded inputs to number classes
2. Then, remaining layers are connected and trained to identify digits
